                    <div id="info">In 1918, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan , may God bless his Soul, was
                        born into the Al Nahyan family, who had ruled the emirate of Abu Dhabi for hundreds of years. He
                        was
                        the youngest of the four sons of Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed, who ruled Abu Dhabi from 1922 – 1926.
                        When
                        Sheikh Sultan’s successor died in 1928, Sheikh Zayed’s eldest brother, Sheikh Shakhbut, was
                        elected
                        by the family to be ruler.
<br>


                        At that time, Abu Dhabi was a part of the Trucial States. When Sheikh Zayed was a child,
                        education
                        was scarce. He received instruction in the principles of Islam and memorized much of the Holy
                        Qur’an, however, and always demonstrated a voracious appetite for knowledge. This led him to
                        accompany the Bedouin tribesmen into the desert.

                        <br>

                        In 1946, Sheikh Zayed was elected as ruler of Al Ain. Immediately at that time, Al Ain began to
                        be
                        developed and to integrate into a township and Agricultural production began to flourish, as did
                        the
                        local economy.
                        <br>


                        On August 6th, 1966, Sheikh Zayed became Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and within weeks a massive
                        development
                        program was underway. Schools, hospitals, roads and housing were constructed. Zayed’s vision had
                        always extended beyond the borders of Abu Dhabi.
                        <br>


                        In 1968, Britain announced that it would withdraw from the area before the end of 1971.
                        Immediately
                        Sheikh Zayed took the lead in calling for a federation of the emirates. The rulers of the
                        emirates
                        moved quickly and on the 2nd December, 1971, the United Arab Emirates formally emerged onto the
                        international stage While Sheikh Zayed himself always attempts to share credit for the
                        remarkable
                        ensuing developments with his fellow members of the Supreme Council of Rulers (comprising the
                        ruler
                        of each of the seven emirates) no-one doubts that, without his wisdom and guidance, they would
                        never
                        have happened. The Supreme Council itself has recognized this by re-electing Sheikh Zayed to
                        successive five-year terms as President.

                <div class="extra-info">
                    Since its establishment, the UAE has confounded international expectations by developing
                    successfully in
                    all areas of life; social services, health and education, communications and technology, trade and
                    finance, at a rate almost unmatched anywhere or at any time. More importantly, these material
                    achievements have occurred against a backdrop of political and social stability.

                    <br>

                    Throughout history, few leaders can have experienced the amount of radical changes that Sheikh Zayed
                    has
                    witnessed. Fewer still could reflect on them in the knowledge that they chose and acted in
                    accordance
                    with their beliefs and for the betterment of humanity, regardless of personal cost, financial or
                    otherwise. Sheikh Zayed has the love and admiration of his people and international recognition and
                    respect, all of which he has earned many times over.<br>



                    On the 2nd of November 2004 Sheikh Zayed, the nation leader had passed away, after a long journey of
                    giving, achievements and development of people and land. In line of the his vision, the nation keeps
                    going under the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the president of
                    united
                    Arab Emirates and the members of the Supreme Council of Rulers and their crown princess.<br>

                    <div id="info">
                        HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, was elected as the new President of
                        the United Arab Emirates on 3 November 2004, to succeed his father, the late HH Sheikh Zayed bin
                        Sultan Al Nahyan, UAE President from 1971 to 2004, from whom, he has said, he learned “the need
                        for patience and prudence in all things.”



                        Since becoming UAE President, HH Sheikh Khalifa has presided over a major re-structuring of both
                        the Federal Government and the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The appointment of a new
                        Cabinet in February 2006, with Vice-President and Dubai Ruler HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al
                        Maktoum as Prime Minister, saw major changes in the portfolios with, crucially, the creation of
                        new ministries devoted to the streamlining and modernizing of the business of government, a new
                        focus on community development and, through the new Ministry of Federal National Council (FNC)
                        Affairs, an important step towards reform of the political process with the introduction of
                        indirect elections for half of the FNC's membership.



                        In his message to the nation on the occasion of the UAE's National Day on 2 December 2005, he
                        noted:

                        "The years ahead require a bigger role for the Federal National Council by empowering it to be
                        an authority that would provide great support and guidance for the executive arm of the
                        government. We shall work to make the Council more capable, more effective and more sensitive to
                        the issues affecting the nation and the people. This would be done by ensuring a more
                        participatory process and the entrenchment of the policy of “Shura” consultation. And through a
                        gradual, organized course, we have decided to start activating the role of the FNC through
                        electing half of its members through councils for each emirate and appointing the other half. By
                        doing this, we will embark on a march that culminates in more participation and interaction from
                        all the citizens of the country. . . . Today, we stand at a threshold of a new era, whose
                        ultimate objective is to entrench the rule of law and due process, accountability, transparency
                        and equal opportunity."

                                Emirates, during which he has given instructions for the building of a number of

                                related to housing, education and the social services.</span></p>

                                Khalifa
                                has overseen dramatic changes too in the government of Abu Dhabi, where particular
                                attention
                                has been paid to two aspects - improvements in terms of efficiency and cost for services
                                provided to the public and the opening up of much of the economy so that greater scope
                                has
                                been provided for direct private investment and for public-private partnerships. During
                                the
                                early years of the Federation, he believes, it was right and appropriate for government
                                to
                                play the leading role, but now, with a burgeoning private sector and with a
                                well-educated
                                population, the time is right for government, both local and federal, to step back and
                                to
                                concentrate on the core areas of government responsibility.</span></p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:arial;">The
                                re-structuring
                                of government, he believes, will only be effective if the people of the UAE take upon
                                themselves the task of contributing effectively. “We have already begun preparing for
                                the
                                new era by promulgating legislation [and] placing some regulatory measures on the
                                existing
                                departments, institutions, activities and relations,” he said in his December 2005
                                National
                                Day message. “This is to tighten up the loose ends, to straighten the curves, put an end

                        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:arial;">It is high time
                                for
                                our political, religious, cultural, information, educational and civil society
                                institutions
                                to take up their responsibilities to instill in our society the values of love of work,
                                to
                                change the negative perceptions about vocational work. It is high time to make them
                                understand the true meaning of work - that it means responsibility and reflects human,
                                civil
                                and religious values. These institutions also need to work hard to diversify the skills

                                significance to individuals and society in general.</span></p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:arial;">While
                                emphasizing
                                the need for a re-structuring at home, not just in terms of government, but also in the
                                way
                                in which the UAE's people look upon their own duties towards society, HH Sheikh Khalifa
                                has,
                                at the same time, continued to ensure that the country pursues an active foreign
                                policy.</span></p>



                        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:22px;"><span style="font-family:arial;">HH Sheikh
                                Khalifa is
                                a strong supporter of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), believing that the
                                success and achievements of this body reflect the depth of understanding reached amongst
                                its
                                leaders. That support was re-affirmed at the 2005 GCC summit conference, held in Abu
                                Dhabi,
                                while he has exchanged numerous visits with the leaders of other GCC states, which have
                                provided him with the opportunity to discuss both ways in which the GCC can continue to
                                develop and other issues of regional and wider importance.</span></p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:22px;"><br>
                            <span style="font-family:arial;">One of the wider issues, of course, has been the continuing
                                turmoil in Iraq, and HH Sheikh Khalifa has pursued a consistent policy of supporting the
                                efforts by Iraq's elected representatives to restore peace and stability, both through
                                offering diplomatic support and through a wide range of assistance for reconstruction of
                                Iraq's shattered economy. At the same time, he has urged the various communities in
                                Iraq,
                                whether regional or religious, to recognize that their future is best guaranteed by
                                working
                                together and by promoting the unity of both the country and its people.</span>

                                by HH Sheikh Khalifa as being of crucial importance is that of the conflict between

                                and the Palestinian people. As has been the case since the creation of the Federation in
                                1971, the UAE has continued to express its support for the Palestinian people, with HH
                                Sheikh Khalifa demonstrating his own personal interest by funding a major housing
                                program,

                                level, HH Sheikh Khalifa noted in a speech on the occasion of the International Day of
                                Solidarity with the Palestinian People in November 2005 that the UAE remained committed

                            Asian states, with whom he has been an active proponent of closer ties ever since they
